# aurelia-webpack-minimalist
Minimalist Aurelia startup project using Webpack for bundling

After spinning my wheels for quite some time trying to get Aurelia working with standard webpack and latest bits, I finally got it working. This is a combination of several sources that just didn't quite work on their own anymore. Here's where some of the "inspiration" came from:
* https://github.com/aurelia/framework/blob/master/doc/article/drafts/manual-webpack-configuration.md
* http://ericmackrodt.com/2016/08/17/a-hello-world-using-aurelia-webpack/
* https://github.com/jods4/aurelia-webpack-build/wiki/Webpack-config

I hope this helps someone else avoid the headache this caused me!
